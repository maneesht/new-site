                                <p>During this internship, Maneesh learned a lot. He was a part of Intel's CCG (Client Computing Group). He was a part of the effort to move Intel forward towards the mobile era.
                                At this job he has learned that many real-world tasks encounter many problems and that the world is very different from academic projects. He learned about the 
                                intricacies of Android, camera handling in Android (low and high-level) and Intel RealSense Cameras. </p>

                                <p>Maneesh, in the summer of 2014, was assigned as the project lead for an application for the Saint Louis Science Center. The application was to go hand-in-hand with the new Agriculture exhibit.
                                The guests would be able to pull up the application and see whatever was physically in the gallery. The point of the project was to make the experience more interactive. So when the guest went to the app a map would appear with a set of markers and each marker would represent some media. Each media would have tags/attributes associated with the media and as you filter the attributes, more/less markers would appear on the map.
                                Currently, he is getting ready for the public launch for the application and exhibit.</p>

                                He started out teaching front-end web development for about 4-7 hours a day. This included HTML & CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, dependency management and much more. </p>

                                    Maneesh started out as an intern learning front-end technologies such as AngularJS and NodeJS.
                                    He was given the chance to write a configurator application using Angular and other front-end technologies.
                                    The application allowed you to select from a group of products and configure each type. The configurability
                                    was based on a custom language written. The team's task was to implement that custom language inside the application.
